# FIRST BADGES
This project is a development effort for FIRST Badges located at FIRSTBadges.com to streamline the process to award badges to FIRST Robotics Competition teams. These badges are designed for participants to show their skills and competencies in a wide variety of areas encompassing STEM skills, 21st century "soft" skills and is integral to helping teams meet their goals for diversity, equity and inclusion.

The badge requirements are established by a group of mentors in Michigan and are aligned to the Michigan curriculum standards and national frameworks.

This specific project is for mentors and coaches of FRC teams, so they have a common and efficient process to award badges and provides automation of the badges.  FRC teams work under strict deadlines and this automation process will support a wider adoption of the badge process.

## Description
This is a small integrated application where a coach/mentor of an FRC team is pre-approved with credentials to the Badgr system (www.badgr.io) to award badges. The mentors access their own account and participants who are already enrolled on their FRC team. 

Mentors can select the participant list and view the badge(s) in progress and update the individual badge requirements.  Once all badge requirements are completed, the mentor can award the badge through the automated connection to Badgr.
